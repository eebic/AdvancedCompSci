## To-Do List

### Summary

This project is a To-Do List application made to help users manage their tasks. It allows users to add tasks, view and edit them, mark tasks as complete, and sort tasks by category. The application also supports filtering tasks to display only incomplete items.

Object-oriented design principles are utilized throughout the project. Key concepts include encapsulation, achieved by defining classes such as Task, Category, and ToDoList to manage their respective data and behaviors. Inheritance is not explicitly used, but the composition is there as classes like ToDoList contain and manage collections of Category and Task objects. Polymorphism is leveraged in the form of method overriding and interface usage for dynamic behavior. This design structure ensures that each class has a distinct responsibility, making the application more organized, easier to understand, and scalable.
